# TextUitl
The TextUtil Class Library for C# used throughout my projects

## Explaination
This is a simple resuable library containing a central for printing out text through methods at different intervals and with different console colors, as well as an implementation class which globalises the different forms of writers. It also contains a validation class, with elements for validating user input and input conversion.

### Build Instructions
To add it to your project, simply clone the repository and add the project file to the dotnet reference with:
```
dotnet add {PROJECTDIRECTORY}/{PROJECTNAME.csproj} reference {REPOSITORYPATH}/TextUtil/TextUtil.csproj
```
